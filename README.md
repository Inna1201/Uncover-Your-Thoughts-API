# Uncover-Your-Thoughts-API
My name is Inna Mamedova, I am a student of Birmingham University Coding Bootcamp.
In this challenge I have build from scratch an API for a social network web application using MongoDB database.



# Project requirements
Build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.
Use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.




# Details
I have created the schema with fields that should contain the database.
I have defined virtuals and getters for the scheema.
I have initialized and exported the models to use them in controllers.
I have created the sample data and seeded the database.
I have defined the API routes to the endpoints.
I have created multiple CRUD requests to be able to track and manage data.
I have tasted application functionality in Insomnia.
