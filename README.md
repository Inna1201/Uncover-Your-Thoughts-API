## Project requirements
Build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.
Use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.



## Details
I have created the schema with fields that should contain the database and defined virtuals and getters for the scheema.
I have initialized and exported the models to use them in controllers.
I have created the sample data and seeded the database.
I have defined the API routes to the endpoints and created multiple CRUD requests to be able to track and manage data.
The application functionality has been tested in Insomnia.
